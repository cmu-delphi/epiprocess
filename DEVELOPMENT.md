## Setting up the development environment

```r
install.packages(c('devtools', 'pkgdown', 'styler', 'lintr')) # install dev dependencies
devtools::install_deps(dependencies = TRUE) # install package dependencies
devtools::document() # generate package meta data and man files
devtools::build() # build package
```

## Validating the package

```r
styler::style_pkg() # format code
lintr::lint_package() # lint code

devtools::test() # test package
devtools::check() # check package for errors
```

## Developing the documentation site

Our CI builds two version of the documentation:

- https://cmu-delphi.github.io/epiprocess/ from the `main` branch and
- https://cmu-delphi.github.io/epiprocess/dev from the `dev` branch.

The documentation site can be previewed locally by running in R:

```r
# Should automatically open a browser
pkgdown::build_site(preview=TRUE)
```

If the above does not open a browser, you can try using a Python server from the
command line:

```bash
R -e 'devtools::document()'
R -e 'pkgdown::build_site()'
python -m http.server -d docs
```

## Versioning

Please follow the guidelines in the [PR template document](.github/pull_request_template.md).

## Planned CRAN release process

Open a release issue and then copy and follow this checklist in the issue (modified from the checklist generated by `usethis::use_release_issue(version = "1.0.2")`):

- [ ] `git pull` on `dev` branch.
- [ ] Make sure all changes are committed and pushed.
- [ ] Check [current CRAN check results](https://cran.rstudio.org/web/checks/check_results_epiprocess.html).
- [ ] `devtools::check(".", manual = TRUE, env_vars = c(NOT_CRAN = "false"))`.
  - Aim for 10/10, no notes.
- [ ] If check works well enough, merge to main. Otherwise open a PR to fix up.
- [ ] [Polish NEWS](https://github.com/cmu-delphi/epiprocess/blob/dev/NEWS.md).
  - Some [guidelines](https://style.tidyverse.org/news.html#news-release).
- [ ] `git checkout main`
- [ ] `git pull`
- [ ] `urlchecker::url_check()`.
  - This may choke on the MIT license url, and that's ok.
- [ ] `devtools::build_readme()`
- [ ] `devtools::check_win_devel()`
- [ ] Have maintainer ("cre" in description) check email for problems.
- [ ] `revdepcheck::revdep_check(num_workers = 4)`.
  - This may choke, it is very sensitive to the binary versions of packages on a given system. Either bypass or ask someone else to run it if you're concerned.
- [ ] Update `cran-comments.md`
- [ ] PR with any changes (and go through the list again) into `dev` and run through the list again.

Submit to CRAN:

- [ ] `devtools::submit_cran()`.
- [ ] Maintainer approves email.

Wait for CRAN...

- [ ] If accepted :tada:, move to next steps. If rejected, fix and resubmit.
- [ ] Open and merge a PR containing any updates made to `main` back to `dev`.
- [ ] `usethis::use_github_release(publish = FALSE)` (publish off, otherwise it won't push) will create a draft release based on the commit hash in CRAN-SUBMISSION and push a tag to the GitHub repo.
- [ ] Go to the repo, verify the release notes, and publish when ready.
