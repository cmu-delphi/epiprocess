# Like normal data objects, set `archive_cases_dv_subset` up as a promise, so it
# doesn't take unnecessary space before it's evaluated. This also avoids a need
# for @include tags. However, this pattern will use unnecessary space after this
# promise is evaluated, because `as_epi_archive` copies `archive_cases_dv_subset_dt`
# and `archive_cases_dv_subset_dt` will stick around along with `archive_cases_dv_subset`
# after they have been evaluated. We may want to add an option to avoid cloning
# in `as_epi_archive` and make use of it here. But we may also want to change
# this into an active binding that copies every time, unless we can hide the
# `DT` field from the user (make it non-`public` in general) or make it
# read-only (in this specific case), so that the user cannot modify the `DT`
# here and potentially mess up examples that they refer to later on.
#
# During development, note that reloading the package and re-evaluating this
# promise should prepare the archive from the DT using any changes that have
# been made to `as_epi_archive`; however, if earlier, any field of
# `archive_cases_dv_subset` was modified using `<-`, a global environment
# binding may have been created with the same name as the package promise, and
# this binding will stick around even when the package is reloaded, and will
# need to be `rm`-d to easily access the refreshed package promise.
