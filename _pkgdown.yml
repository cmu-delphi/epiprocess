# Colors should stay consistent across epipredict, epiprocess, and epidatr,
# using Carnegie Red
# https://www.cmu.edu/brand/brand-guidelines/visual-identity/colors.html

# This is to give a default value to the `mode` parameter in the
# `pkgdown::build_site` function. This is useful when building the site locally,
# as it will default to `devel` mode. In practice, this should all be handled
# dynamically by the CI/CD pipeline.
