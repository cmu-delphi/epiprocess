The [`{epiprocess}`](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/epiprocess/) package works
with epidemiological time series and version data to provide situational
awareness, processing and transformations in preparation for modeling, and
version-faithful model backtesting.  It contains:

- `epi_df`, a class for working with epidemiological time series data;
- `epi_archive`, a class for working with the version history of such time series data;
- sample data in these formats;
- [`{dplyr}`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)-esque "verbs" for common data
  transformations (e.g., 7-day averages);
- functions for exploratory data analysis and situational awareness (e.g.,
  outlier detection and growth rate estimation); and
- [`{dplyr}`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/)-esque "verbs" for version-faithful
  "pseudoprospective" backtesting of models, and other version history analysis
  and transformations.

It is part of a broader suite of packages that includes
[`{epipredict}`](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/epipredict/),
[`{epidatr}`](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/epidatr/),
[`{rtestim}`](https://dajmcdon.github.io/rtestim/), and
[`{epidatasets}`](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/epidatasets/), for accessing,
analyzing, and forecasting epidemiological time series data. We have expanded
documentation and demonstrations for some of these packages available in an
online "book" format [here](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-tooling-book/).

## Motivation

[`{epiprocess}`](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/epiprocess/) and
[`{epipredict}`](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/epipredict/) are designed to lower
the barrier to entry and implementation cost for epidemiological time series
analysis and forecasting. Epidemiologists and forecasting groups repeatedly and
separately have had to rush to implement this type of functionality in a much
more ad hoc manner; we are trying to save such effort in the future by providing
well-documented, tested, and general packages that can be called for many common
tasks instead.

[`{epiprocess}`](https://github.com/cmu-delphi/epiprocess/) also provides tools
to help avoid a particularly common pitfall in analysis and forecasting:
ignoring reporting latency and revisions to a data set. This can, for example,
lead to one retrospectively analyzing a surveillance signal or forecasting model
and concluding that it is much more accurate than it actually was in real time,
or producing always-decreasing forecasts on data sets where initial surveillance
estimates are systematically revised upward. Storing and working with version
history can help avoid these issues.

## Intended audience

We expect users to be proficient in R, and familiar with the
[`{dplyr}`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org/) and
[`{tidyr}`](https://tidyr.tidyverse.org/) packages.

## Installing

This package is not on CRAN yet, so it can be installed using the
[`{devtools}`](https://devtools.r-lib.org) package:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("cmu-delphi/epiprocess", ref = "main")
```

Building the vignettes, such as this getting started guide, takes a significant
amount of time. They are not included in the package by default. If you want to
include vignettes, then use this modified command:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("cmu-delphi/epiprocess",
  ref = "main",
  build_vignettes = TRUE, dependencies = TRUE
)
```

## Getting data into `epi_df` format

We'll start by showing how to get data into
<code><a href="../reference/epi_df.html">epi_df</a></code> format, which is just
a tibble with a bit of special structure, and is the format assumed by all of
the functions in the `epiprocess` package. An `epi_df` object has (at least) the
following columns:

* `geo_value`: the geographic value associated with each row of measurements.
* `time_value`: the time value associated with each row of measurements.

It can have any number of other columns which can serve as measured variables,
which we also broadly refer to as signal variables. The documentation for
 gives more details about this data format.

A data frame or tibble that has `geo_value` and `time_value` columns can be
converted into an `epi_df` object, using the function `as_epi_df()`. As an
example, we'll work with daily cumulative COVID-19 cases from four U.S. states:
CA, FL, NY, and TX, over time span from mid 2020 to early 2022, and we'll use
the [`epidatr`](https://github.com/cmu-delphi/epidatr) package
to fetch this data from the [COVIDcast
API](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast.html).

```{r, message = FALSE}
library(epidatr)
library(epiprocess)
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(withr)

cases <- pub_covidcast(
  source = "jhu-csse",
  signals = "confirmed_cumulative_num",
  geo_type = "state",
  time_type = "day",
  geo_values = "ca,fl,ny,tx",
  time_values = epirange(20200301, 20220131),
)

colnames(cases)
```

As we can see, a data frame returned by `epidatr::pub_covidcast()` has the
columns required for an `epi_df` object (along with many others). We can use
`as_epi_df()`, with specification of some relevant metadata, to bring the data
frame into `epi_df` format.

```{r, message = FALSE}
x <- as_epi_df(cases,
  as_of = max(cases$issue)
) %>%
  select(geo_value, time_value, total_cases = value)

class(x)
summary(x)
head(x)
attributes(x)$metadata
```

## Some details on metadata

In general, an `epi_df` object has the following fields in its metadata:

* `geo_type`: the type for the geo values.
* `as_of`: the time value at which the given data were available.

Metadata for an `epi_df` object `x` can be accessed (and altered) via
`attributes(x)$metadata`. The field, `geo_type`,is not currently used by any
downstream functions in the `epiprocess` package, and serve only as useful bits
of information to convey about the data set at hand. The last field here,
`as_of`, is one of the most unique aspects of an `epi_df` object.

In brief, we can think of an `epi_df` object as a single snapshot of a data set
that contains the most up-to-date values of some signals of interest, as of the
time specified `as_of`. For example, if `as_of` is January 31, 2022, then the
`epi_df` object has the most up-to-date version of the data available as of
January 31, 2022. The `epiprocess` package also provides a companion data
structure called `epi_archive`, which stores the full version history of a given
data set. See the [archive
vignette](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/epiprocess/articles/archive.html) for
more.

If `geo_type` or `as_of` arguments are missing in a call to `as_epi_df()`, then
this function will try to infer them from the passed object. Usually, `geo_type`
can be inferred from the `geo_value` columns, respectively, but inferring the
`as_of` field is not as easy. See the documentation for `as_epi_df()` more
details.

```{r}
x <- as_epi_df(cases, as_of = as.Date("2024-03-20")) %>%
  select(geo_value, time_value, total_cases = value)

attributes(x)$metadata
```

## Using additional key columns in `epi_df`
In the following examples we will show how to create an `epi_df` with additional keys.

### Converting a `tsibble` that has county code as an extra key
```{r}
ex1 <- tibble(
  geo_value = rep(c("ca", "fl", "pa"), each = 3),
  county_code = c(
    "06059", "06061", "06067",
    "12111", "12113", "12117",
    "42101", "42103", "42105"
  ),
  time_value = rep(seq(as.Date("2020-06-01"), as.Date("2020-06-03"), by = "day"), length.out = length(geo_value)),
  value = seq_along(geo_value) + 0.01 * withr::with_rng_version("3.0.0", withr::with_seed(42, length(geo_value)))
) %>%
  as_tsibble(index = time_value, key = c(geo_value, county_code))

ex1 <- as_epi_df(x = ex1, as_of = "2020-06-03")
```

The metadata now includes `county_code` as an extra key.
```{r}
attr(ex1, "metadata")
```


### Dealing with misspecified column names

`epi_df` requires there to be columns `geo_value` and `time_value`, if they do not exist then `as_epi_df()` throws an error.
```{r, error = TRUE}
data.frame(
  # misnamed
  state = rep(c("ca", "fl", "pa"), each = 3),
  # extra key
  pol = rep(c("blue", "swing", "swing"), each = 3),
  # misnamed
  reported_date = rep(seq(as.Date("2020-06-01"), as.Date("2020-06-03"), by = "day"), length.out = length(geo_value)),
  value = seq_along(geo_value) + 0.01 * withr::with_rng_version("3.0.0", withr::with_seed(42, length(geo_value)))
) %>% as_epi_df(as_of = as.Date("2024-03-20"))
```

The columns can be renamed to match `epi_df` format. In the example below, notice there is also an additional key `pol`.
```{r}
ex2 <- tibble(
  # misnamed
  state = rep(c("ca", "fl", "pa"), each = 3),
  # extra key
  pol = rep(c("blue", "swing", "swing"), each = 3),
  # misnamed
  reported_date = rep(seq(as.Date("2020-06-01"), as.Date("2020-06-03"), by = "day"), length.out = length(state)),
  value = seq_along(state) + 0.01 * withr::with_rng_version("3.0.0", withr::with_seed(42, length(state)))
) %>% data.frame()

head(ex2)

ex2 <- ex2 %>%
  rename(geo_value = state, time_value = reported_date) %>%
  as_epi_df(
    as_of = "2020-06-03",
    other_keys = "pol"
  )

attr(ex2, "metadata")
```


### Adding additional keys to an `epi_df` object

In the above examples, all the keys are added to objects that are not `epi_df` objects. We illustrate how to add keys to an `epi_df` object.

We use a toy data set included in `epiprocess` prepared using the `covidcast` library and are filtering to a single state for simplicity.

```{r}
ex3 <- jhu_csse_county_level_subset %>%
  filter(time_value > "2021-12-01", state_name == "Massachusetts") %>%
  slice_tail(n = 6)

attr(ex3, "metadata") # geo_type is county currently
```

Now we add `state` (MA) and `pol` as new columns to the data and as new keys to the metadata. Reminder that lower case state name abbreviations are what we would expect if this were a `geo_value` column.

```{r}
ex3 <- ex3 %>%
  as_tibble() %>% # needed to add the additional metadata
  mutate(
    state = rep(tolower("MA"), 6),
    pol = rep(c("blue", "swing", "swing"), each = 2)
  ) %>%
  as_epi_df(other_keys = c("state", "pol"), as_of = as.Date("2024-03-20"))

attr(ex3, "metadata")
```

Note that the two additional keys we added, `state` and `pol`, are specified as a character vector in the `other_keys` argument. They must be specified in this manner so that downstream actions on the `epi_df`, like model fitting and prediction, can recognize and use these keys.

Currently `other_keys` metadata in `epi_df` doesn't impact `epi_slide()`, contrary to `other_keys` in `as_epi_archive` which affects how the update data is interpreted.

## Working with `epi_df` objects downstream

Data in `epi_df` format should be easy to work with downstream, since it is a
very standard tabular data format; in the other vignettes, we'll walk through
some basic signal processing tasks using functions provided in the `epiprocess`
package. Of course, we can also write custom code for other downstream uses,
like plotting, which is pretty easy to do `ggplot2`.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)
theme_set(theme_bw())

ggplot(x, aes(x = time_value, y = total_cases, color = geo_value)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_date(minor_breaks = "month", date_labels = "%b %y") +
  labs(x = "Date", y = "Cumulative COVID-19 cases", color = "State")
```

As a last couple examples, we'll look at some more data sets just to show how
we might get them into `epi_df` format. Data on daily new (not cumulative) SARS
cases in Canada in 2003, from the
[outbreaks](https://github.com/reconverse/outbreaks) package:

```{r}
x <- outbreaks::sars_canada_2003 %>%
  mutate(geo_value = "ca") %>%
  select(geo_value, time_value = date, starts_with("cases")) %>%
  as_epi_df(as_of = as.Date("2024-03-20"))

head(x)

library(tidyr)
x <- x %>%
  pivot_longer(starts_with("cases"), names_to = "type") %>%
  mutate(type = substring(type, 7))

yrange <- range(
  x %>%
    group_by(time_value) %>%
    summarize(value = sum(value)) %>%
    pull(value)
)

ggplot(x, aes(x = time_value, y = value)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = type)) +
  scale_x_date(minor_breaks = "month", date_labels = "%b %y") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = yrange[1]:yrange[2]) +
  labs(x = "Date", y = "SARS cases in Canada", fill = "Type")
```

Get confirmed cases of Ebola in Sierra Leone from 2014 to 2015 by province and
date of onset, prepared from line list data from the same package:

```{r, fig.width = 9, fig.height = 6}
x <- outbreaks::ebola_sierraleone_2014 %>%
  select(district, date_of_onset, status) %>%
  mutate(province = case_when(
    district %in% c("Kailahun", "Kenema", "Kono") ~
      "Eastern",
    district %in% c(
      "Bombali", "Kambia", "Koinadugu", "Port Loko",
      "Tonkolili"
    ) ~
      "Northern",
    district %in% c("Bo", "Bonthe", "Moyamba", "Pujehun") ~
      "Sourthern",
    district %in% c("Western Rural", "Western Urban") ~
      "Western"
  )) %>%
  group_by(geo_value = province, time_value = date_of_onset) %>%
  summarise(cases = sum(status == "confirmed"), .groups = "drop") %>%
  complete(geo_value,
    time_value = full_seq(time_value, period = 1),
    fill = list(cases = 0)
  ) %>%
  as_epi_df(as_of = as.Date("2024-03-20"))

ggplot(x, aes(x = time_value, y = cases)) +
  geom_col(aes(fill = geo_value), show.legend = FALSE) +
  facet_wrap(~geo_value, scales = "free_y") +
  scale_x_date(minor_breaks = "month", date_labels = "%b %y") +
  labs(x = "Date", y = "Confirmed cases of Ebola in Sierra Leone")
```
