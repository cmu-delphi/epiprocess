```{r, include = FALSE}
source("_common.R")
```

The `epiprocess` package provides some simple functionality for computing lagged
correlations between two signals, across locations or time (or other variables), via
`epi_cor()`. This function is really just a convenience wrapper over some basic
commands: it first performs specified time shifts, then computes correlations,
grouped in a specified way. In this vignette, we'll examine correlations between
state-level COVID-19 case and death rates, smoothed using 7-day trailing
averages.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(epiprocess)
library(dplyr)
```

The data is included in this package (via the [`epidatasets` package](https://cmu-delphi.github.io/epidatasets/)) and can be loaded with:
```{r}
x <- covid_case_death_rates_extended %>%
  arrange(geo_value, time_value)
```

The data can also be fetched from the Delphi Epidata API with the following query:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
library(epidatr)

d <- as.Date("2024-03-20")

x <- pub_covidcast(
  source = "jhu-csse",
  signals = "confirmed_7dav_incidence_prop",
  geo_type = "state",
  time_type = "day",
  geo_values = "*",
  time_values = epirange(20200301, 20211231),
  as_of = d
) %>%
  select(geo_value, time_value, case_rate = value)

y <- pub_covidcast(
  source = "jhu-csse",
  signals = "deaths_7dav_incidence_prop",
  geo_type = "state",
  time_type = "day",
  geo_values = "*",
  time_values = epirange(20200301, 20211231),
  as_of = d
) %>%
  select(geo_value, time_value, death_rate = value)

x <- x %>%
  full_join(y, by = c("geo_value", "time_value")) %>%
  as_epi_df(as_of = d)
```

## Correlations grouped by time

The `epi_cor()` function operates on an `epi_df` object, and it requires further
specification of the variables to correlate, in its next two arguments (`var1`
and `var2`).

In general, we can specify any grouping variable (or combination of variables)
for the correlation computations in a call to `epi_cor()`, via the `cor_by`
argument. This potentially leads to many ways to compute correlations. There are
always at least two ways to compute correlations in an `epi_df`: grouping by
time value, and by geo value. The former is obtained via `cor_by = time_value`.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(ggplot2)

z1 <- epi_cor(x, case_rate, death_rate, cor_by = "time_value")

ggplot(z1, aes(x = time_value, y = cor)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_x_date(minor_breaks = "month", date_labels = "%b %y") +
  labs(x = "Date", y = "Correlation")
```

The above plot addresses the question: "on any given day, are case and death
rates linearly associated, across the U.S. states?". We might be interested in
broadening this question, instead asking: "on any given day, do higher case
rates tend to associate with higher death rates?", removing the dependence on a
linear relationship. The latter can be addressed using Spearman correlation,
accomplished by setting `method = "spearman"` in the call to `epi_cor()`.
Spearman correlation is highly robust and invariant to monotone transformations.

## Lagged correlations

We might also be interested in how case rates associate with death rates in the
*future*. Using the `dt1` parameter in `epi_cor()`, we can lag case rates back
any number of days we want, before calculating correlations. Below, we set `dt1
= -10`. This means that `var1 = case_rate` will be lagged by 10 days, so that
case rates on June 1st will be correlated with death rates on June 11th.  (It
might also help to think of it this way: death rates on a certain day will be
correlated with case rates at an offset of -10 days.)

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
z2 <- epi_cor(x, case_rate, death_rate, cor_by = time_value, dt1 = -10)

z <- rbind(
  z1 %>% mutate(lag = 0),
  z2 %>% mutate(lag = 10)
) %>%
  mutate(lag = as.factor(lag))

ggplot(z, aes(x = time_value, y = cor)) +
  geom_line(aes(color = lag)) +
  scale_x_date(minor_breaks = "month", date_labels = "%b %y") +
  labs(x = "Date", y = "Correlation", col = "Lag")
```

Note that `epi_cor()` takes an argument `shift_by` that determines the grouping
to use for the time shifts. The default is `geo_value`, which makes sense in our
problem at hand (but in another setting, we may want to group by geo value and
another variable---say, age---before time shifting).

We can see that, generally, lagging the case rates back by 10 days improves the
correlations, confirming case rates are better correlated with death rates 10
days from now.

## Correlations grouped by state

The second option we have is to group by geo value, obtained by setting `cor_by
= geo_value`. We'll again look at correlations for both 0- and 10-day lagged
case rates.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
z1 <- epi_cor(x, case_rate, death_rate, cor_by = geo_value)
z2 <- epi_cor(x, case_rate, death_rate, cor_by = geo_value, dt1 = -10)

z <- rbind(
  z1 %>% mutate(lag = 0),
  z2 %>% mutate(lag = 10)
) %>%
  mutate(lag = as.factor(lag))

ggplot(z, aes(cor)) +
  geom_density(aes(fill = lag, col = lag), alpha = 0.5) +
  labs(x = "Correlation", y = "Density", fill = "Lag", col = "Lag")
```

We can again see that, generally speaking, lagging the case rates back by 10
days improves the correlations.

## More systematic lag analysis

Next we perform a more systematic investigation of the correlations over a broad
range of lag values.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
library(purrr)
lags <- 0:35

z <- map_dfr(lags, function(lag) {
  epi_cor(x, case_rate, death_rate, cor_by = geo_value, dt1 = -lag) %>%
    mutate(lag = .env$lag)
})

z %>%
  group_by(lag) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(cor, na.rm = TRUE)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = lag, y = mean)) +
  geom_line() +
  geom_point() +
  labs(x = "Lag", y = "Mean correlation")
```

We can see that some pretty clear curvature here in the mean correlation between
case and death rates (where the correlations come from grouping by geo value) as
a function of lag. The maximum occurs at a lag of somewhere around 17 days.
