\title{Subset of daily doctor visits and cases in archive format}
\format{
An \code{epi_archive} data format. The data table DT has 129,638 rows and 5 columns:
\describe{
\item{geo_value}{the geographic value associated with each row of measurements.}
\item{time_value}{the time value associated with each row of measurements.}
\item{version}{the time value specifying the version for each row of measurements. }
\item{percent_cli}{percentage of doctorâ€™s visits with CLI (COVID-like
illness) computed from medical insurance claims}
\item{case_rate_7d_av}{7-day average signal of number of new confirmed
deaths due to COVID-19 per 100,000 population, daily}
}

Modifications:
\itemize{
\item \href{https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast-signals/doctor-visits.html}{From
the COVIDcast Doctor Visits API}: The signal \code{percent_cli} is taken
directly from the API without changes.
\item \href{https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast-signals/jhu-csse.html}{From
the COVIDcast Epidata API}: \code{case_rate_7d_av} signal was computed by Delphi
from the original JHU-CSSE data by calculating moving averages of the
preceding 7 days, so the signal for June 7 is the average of the underlying
data for June 1 through 7, inclusive.
\item Furthermore, the data is a subset of the full dataset, the signal names
slightly altered, and formatted into a tibble.

\description{
This data source is based on information about outpatient visits,
provided to us by health system partners, and also contains confirmed
COVID-19 cases based on reports made available by the Center for
Systems Science and Engineering at Johns Hopkins University.
This example data ranges from June 1, 2020 to Dec 1, 2021, and
is also limited to California, Florida, Texas, and New York.
