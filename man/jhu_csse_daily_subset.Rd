Modifications:
\itemize{
\item \href{https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast-signals/jhu-csse.html}{From
the COVIDcast Epidata API}: The case signal is taken directly from the JHU
CSSE \href{https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19}{COVID-19 GitHub
repository}. The rate signals were computed by Delphi using Census
population data. The 7-day average signals were computed by Delphi by
calculating moving averages of the preceding 7 days, so the signal for June
7 is the average of the underlying data for June 1 through 7, inclusive.
\item Furthermore, the data has been limited to a very small number of rows, the
signal names slightly altered, and formatted into a tibble.
