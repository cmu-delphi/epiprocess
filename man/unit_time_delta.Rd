\title{Object that, added to time_values of time_type, advances by one time step/interval}
\usage{
unit_time_delta(time_type)
}
\arguments{
\item{time_type}{string; \code{epi_df}'s or \code{epi_archive}'s \code{time_type}}
}
\value{
an object \code{u} such that \code{time_values + u} represents advancing by one
time step / moving to the subsequent time interval for any \code{time_values}
object of time type \code{time_type}, and such that \code{time_values + k * u} for
integerish vector \code{k} advances by \code{k} steps (with vectorization,
recycling).
