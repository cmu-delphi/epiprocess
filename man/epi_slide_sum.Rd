\title{Optimized slide function for performing rolling sums on an \code{epi_df} object}
\usage{
epi_slide_sum(
  x,
  col_names,
  ...,
  before = NULL,
  after = NULL,
  ref_time_values = NULL,
  new_col_name = NULL,
  as_list_col = NULL,
  names_sep = NULL,
  all_rows = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The \code{epi_df} object under consideration, \link[dplyr:group_by]{grouped}
or ungrouped. If ungrouped, all data in \code{x} will be treated as part of a
single data group.}

\item{col_names}{<\code{\link[=dplyr_tidy_select]{tidy-select}}> An unquoted column
name(e.g., \code{cases}), multiple column names (e.g., \code{c(cases, deaths)}), or
\link[tidyselect:language]{other tidy-select expression}. Variable names can
be used as if they were positions in the data frame, so expressions like
\code{x:y} can be used to select a range of variables. If you have the desired
column names stored in a vector \code{vars}, use \code{col_names = all_of(vars)}.

The tidy-selection renaming interface is not supported, and cannot be used
to provide output column names; if you want to customize the output column
names, use \code{\link[dplyr:rename]{dplyr::rename}} after the slide.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments to pass to \code{data.table::frollsum}, for
example, \code{na.rm} and \code{algo}. \code{data.table::frollsum} is automatically
passed the data \code{x} to operate on, the window size \code{n}, and the alignment
\code{align}. Providing these args via \code{...} will cause an error.}

\item{before, after}{How far \code{before} and \code{after} each \code{ref_time_value} should
the sliding window extend? At least one of these two arguments must be
provided; the other's default will be 0. The accepted values for these
depend on the type of the \code{time_value} column:
\itemize{
\item if it is a Date and the cadence is daily, then they can be integers
(which will be interpreted in units of days) or difftimes with units
"days"
\item if it is a Date and the cadence is weekly, then they must be difftimes
with units "weeks"
\item if it is an integer, then they must be integers
}

Endpoints of the window are inclusive. Common settings:
\itemize{
\item For trailing/right-aligned windows from \code{ref_time_value - k} to
\code{ref_time_value}: either pass \code{before=k} by itself, or pass \verb{before=k, after=0}.
\item For center-aligned windows from \code{ref_time_value - k} to
\code{ref_time_value + k}: pass \verb{before=k, after=k}.
\item For leading/left-aligned windows from \code{ref_time_value} to
\code{ref_time_value + k}: either pass pass \code{after=k} by itself,
or pass \verb{before=0, after=k}.
}

See "Details:" on how missing rows are handled within the window.}

\item{ref_time_values}{Time values for sliding computations, meaning, each
element of this vector serves as the reference time point for one sliding
window. If missing, then this will be set to all unique time values in the
underlying data table, by default.}

\item{new_col_name}{Character vector indicating the name(s) of the new
column(s) that will contain the derivative values. Default
is "slide_value"; note that setting \code{new_col_name} equal to any existing
column names will overwrite those columns. If \code{names_sep} is \code{NULL},
\code{new_col_name} must be the same length as \code{col_names}.}

\item{as_list_col}{Not supported. Included to match \code{epi_slide} interface.}

\item{names_sep}{String specifying the separator to use in \code{tidyr::unnest()}
when \code{as_list_col = FALSE}. Default is "_". Using \code{NULL} drops the prefix
from \code{new_col_name} entirely.}

\item{all_rows}{If \code{all_rows = TRUE}, then all rows of \code{x} will be kept in
the output even with \code{ref_time_values} provided, with some type of missing
value marker for the slide computation output column(s) for \code{time_value}s
outside \code{ref_time_values}; otherwise, there will be one row for each row in
\code{x} that had a \code{time_value} in \code{ref_time_values}. Default is \code{FALSE}. The
missing value marker is the result of \code{vctrs::vec_cast}ing \code{NA} to the type
of the slide computation output. If using \code{as_list_col = TRUE}, note that
the missing marker is a \code{NULL} entry in the list column; for certain
operations, you might want to replace these \code{NULL} entries with a different
\code{NA} marker.}
}
\value{
An \code{epi_df} object given by appending one or more new columns to
\code{x}, named according to the \code{new_col_name} argument.
}
\description{
Slides an n-timestep sum over variables in an \code{epi_df} object. See the \href{https://cmu-delphi.github.io/epiprocess/articles/slide.html}{slide vignette} for
examples.
}
\details{
Wrapper around \code{epi_slide_opt} with \code{f = datatable::frollsum}.

To "slide" means to apply a function over a rolling window of time
steps for each data group, where the window is centered at a reference time
and left and right endpoints are given by the \code{before} and \code{after}
arguments.
If there are not enough time steps available to complete the window at any
given reference time, then \verb{epi_slide_*()} will fail; it requires a
complete window to perform the computation. For a centrally-aligned slide
of \code{n} \code{time_value}s in a sliding window, set \code{before = (n-1)/2} and \code{after = (n-1)/2} when the number of \code{time_value}s in a sliding window is odd and
\code{before = n/2-1} and \code{after = n/2} when \code{n} is even.

Sometimes, we want to experiment with various trailing or leading window
widths and compare the slide outputs. In the (uncommon) case where
zero-width windows are considered, manually pass both the \code{before} and
\code{after} arguments.
