Modifications:
\itemize{
\item \href{https://cmu-delphi.github.io/delphi-epidata/api/covidcast-signals/jhu-csse.html}{From
the COVIDcast Epidata API}: These signals are taken directly from the JHU
CSSE \href{https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19}{COVID-19 GitHub
repository} without changes. The 7-day average signals are computed by
Delphi by calculating moving averages of the preceding 7 days, so the
signal for June 7 is the average of the underlying data for June 1 through
7, inclusive.
\item Furthermore, the data has been limited to a very small number of rows, the
signal names slightly altered, and formatted into a tibble.
