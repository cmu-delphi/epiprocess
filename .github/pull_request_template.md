### Checklist

Please:

-   [ ] Make sure this PR is against "dev", not "main".
-   [ ] Request a review from one of the current epiprocess main reviewers:
        brookslogan, nmdefries.
-   [ ] Makes sure to bump the version number in `DESCRIPTION` and `NEWS.md`.
        Always increment the patch version number (the third number), unless you are
        making a release PR from dev to main, in which case increment the minor
        version number (the second number).
-   [ ] Describe changes made in NEWS.md, making sure breaking changes
        (backwards-incompatible changes to the documented interface) are noted.
        Collect the changes under the next release number (e.g. if you are on
        0.7.2, then write your changes under the 0.8 heading).
